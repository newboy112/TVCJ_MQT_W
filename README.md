# TVCJ_MQT_W
##In the watermark embedding and extraction process, we adaptively embed the encrypted watermark by applying one-level Quaternion Wavelet Transform (QWT) and Quaternion Slant Transform to the blue channel of the color image, and then invert the watermarked low-frequency sub-bands by the Inverse QWT and synthesize them with the R and G channels to obtain the watermarked image.
The main execution function can be found in ‘main_ZP_new.m’. The attack test can be found in ‘attack_color.m’.

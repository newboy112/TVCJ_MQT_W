# TVCJ_MQT_W
##In the watermark embedding and extraction process, we adaptively embed and extract the encrypted watermark by applying multiple Quaternion  Transforms to the blue channel of the color image, and then perform the watermarked low-frequency sub-bands by the Inverse QWT and synthesize them with the R and G channels to obtain the watermarked image.
The main embedding and execution function can be found in ‘main_ZP_new.m’. The attack test can be found in ‘attack_color.m’.

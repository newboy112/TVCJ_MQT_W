# TVCJ_MQT_W
##In the watermark embedding and extraction process, we adaptively embed and extract the encrypted watermark by applying multiple quaternion transforms to the blue channel of the color image, and then process the low-frequency subbands by the corresponding inverse transforms and synthesize them with the R and G channels to obtain the watermarked image.
The main embedding and execution functions can be found in ‘main_ZP_new.m’. The attack test can be found in ‘attack_color.m’.
